# Python Find Multiples of Two

## Description
In this exercise, you will build a program that takes a value, integer , and returns a list of its multiples up to another value, limit . If limit is a multiple of integer, it should be included as well. There will only ever be positive integers passed into the function, not consisting of 0. The limit will always be higher than the base.

## Behavior Driven Development
The program should display even numbers/multiples of two within a given range

## Pseudocode
> Define a function to get multiples of two

> define a list of integers to find if they are multiples of 2

> Loop through the list to check if they are multiples of 2

> Return a list of multiples

## Python Code
''' text
#check out this program
def multiples ():
    y = list (range(1,21))
    for x in y:
        if x % 2 == 0:
            print(x)
multiples()
